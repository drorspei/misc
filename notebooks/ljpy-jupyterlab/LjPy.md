# LjPy Jupyter Lab Talk
----
Don't forget:
1. Set timer for talk, don't want to go overtime!
2. Show `htop` to make sure cpu and memory are fine throughout.

### Introduce Myself
1. Python for personal projects and math research for about fifteen years
2. Currently CTO at Bugatone Ltd., working on using earphones as sensors

3. Moved to Ljubljana a year in pol ago

### History before Jupyter Lab:
1. Idle. Other things I'm not familiar with? (e.g. IPP and LazyPython)
* IPython:
    * Completion - variables (functions, classes, etc.), function argument names, imports
    * Magics - eg. `%timeit`, `%reload`, `%hist`
    * Input history (and output)
* Qt console - I've never used it O_O
    1. Cusotmizable GUI, e.g. fonts, colors
    * Easy to have multiple views on same console (not restricted to Qt)
    * OMG Inlined plots
* IPython/Jupyter Notebooks - **A new era**
    * Visual supremacy - *systematic organization* in files: mix of text, code, and output
    * Collaboration supremacy - sharing of notebooks, open science, e.g. **LIGO**\*
    * **Widgetsssss**!!! More plotting and stuff.
    * Rich output - **Pandas** is readable! And later with widgets, also interactive
    * Other kernels - e.g. R, Julia, **SageMath**, **Xeus-Cling**
        
### Jupyter Lab - A new new era

1. Many file types - Markdown, csv, images, json
* Themes
* Multiple tab views
* Terminal
* Console
* Inspector
* Multiple views on **same kernel**
* Lots of extensions:
    * Matplotlib
    * Plotly
    * Beakerx
    * Drawio
    * Cool status bar
    * Variable inspector
    * Github
